Modelling and Simulation Tools
==============================

Here we will instroduce various software tools used throughout the workshop, ranging from desktop applications through to web-based applications and programming interfaces.
As mentioned in :numref:`workshop_philosophy` we will cover a range of tools from various domains, and attempt to demonstrate how with the use of appropriate standards they can be chained together to achieve complex workflows through the use of harmonised semantics.

The hands-on tutorials will include specific tasks for attendees to choose from to help gain familiarity with each of the tools, depending on your interests.
