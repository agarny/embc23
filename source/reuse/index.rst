Community & reuse
==============================

In this part of the workshop, we will demonstrate how standards are used to share information across modelling tools that can be utilised in clinical applications.
We will then show how this can be reused in people's own work using their own tools but now with credibility.

We will demonstrate how to create a FAIR physiological model that can be submitted to the Physiome journal to create an artifact to provide evidence of credibility.
