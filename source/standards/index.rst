Standards
=========

In this part of the workshop, we will introduce relevant standards and formats that are used throughout the workshop.
As mentioned in :numref:`workshop_philosophy` we will cover a range of standards from various domains, and attempt to demonstrate how they can be linked together through the use of harmonised semantics (see, for example, :cite:t:`neal_harmonizing_2019`).

The hands-on tutorials will include specific options to help attendees gain familiarity with the standards, the tools for working with them, and the APIs and services that can be used to integrate them into your own tools and methods.
