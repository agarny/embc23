	abstract = {With the ever increasing use of computational models in the biosciences, the need to share models and reproduce the results of published studies efficiently and easily is becoming more important. To this end, various standards have been proposed that can be used to describe models, simulations, data or other essential information in a consistent fashion. These constitute various separate components required to reproduce a given published scientific result.

	abstract = {The NIH Common Fund’s Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC) initiative is a large-scale program that seeks to accelerate the development of therapeutic devices that modulate electrical activity in nerves to improve organ function. Integral to the SPARC program are the rich anatomical and functional datasets produced by investigators across the SPARC consortium that provide key details about organ-specific circuitry, including structural and functional connectivity, mapping of cell types and molecular profiling. These datasets are provided to the research community through an open data platform, the SPARC Portal. To ensure SPARC datasets are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR), they are all submitted to the SPARC portal following a standard scheme established by the SPARC Curation Team, called the SPARC Data Structure (SDS). Inspired by the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), the SDS has been designed to capture the large variety of data generated by SPARC investigators who are coming from all fields of biomedical research. Here we present the rationale and design of the SDS, including a description of the SPARC curation process and the automated tools for complying with the SDS, including the SDS validator and Software to Organize Data Automatically (SODA) for SPARC. The objective is to provide detailed guidelines for anyone desiring to comply with the SDS. Since the SDS are suitable for any type of biomedical research data, it can be adopted by any group desiring to follow the FAIR data principles for managing their data, even outside of the SPARC consortium. Finally, this manuscript provides a foundational framework that can be used by any organization desiring to either adapt the SDS to suit the specific needs of their data or simply desiring to design their own FAIR data sharing scheme from scratch.},

The annual event brings together researchers, biocurators and software engineers to present recent results and discuss future work in the area of standards for systems and synthetic biology. The COMBINE initiative coordinates the development of various community standards and formats for computational models in the life sciences. Over the past 10 years, COMBINE has brought together standard communities that have further developed and harmonized their standards for better interoperability of models and data. COMBINE 2019 was co-located with a stakeholder workshop of the European EU-STANDS4PM initiative that aims at harmonized data and model standardization for {\textless}em{\textgreater}in silico{\textless}/em{\textgreater} models in the field of personalized medicine, as well as with the FAIRDOM PALs meeting to discuss findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) data sharing. This report briefly describes the work discussed in invited and contributed talks as well as during breakout sessions. It also highlights recent advancements in data, model, and annotation standardization efforts. Finally, this report concludes with some challenges and opportunities that this community will face during the next 10 years.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The issue of reproducibility of computational models and the related FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) are examined in a specific test case. I analyze a computational model of the segment polarity network in Drosophila embryos published in 2000. Despite the high number of citations to this publication, 23 years later the model is barely accessible, and consequently not interoperable. Following the text of the original publication allowed successfully encoding the model for the open source software COPASI. Subsequently saving the model in the SBML format allowed it to be reused in other open source software packages. Submission of this SBML encoding of the model to the BioModels database enables its findability and accessibility. This demonstrates how the FAIR principles can be successfully enabled by using open source software, widely adopted standards, and public repositories, facilitating reproducibility and reuse of computational cell biology models that will outlive the specific software used.},

	abstract = {Simulating complex biological and physiological systems and predicting their behaviours under different conditions remains challenging. Breaking systems into smaller and more manageable modules can address this challenge, assisting both model development and simulation. Nevertheless, existing computational models in biology and physiology are often not modular and therefore difficult to assemble into larger models. Even when this is possible, the resulting model may not be useful due to inconsistencies either with the laws of physics or the physiological behaviour of the system. Here, we propose a general methodology for composing models, combining the energy-based bond graph approach with semantics-based annotations. This approach improves model composition and ensures that a composite model is physically plausible. As an example, we demonstrate this approach to automated model composition using a model of human arterial circulation. The major benefit is that modellers can spend more time on understanding the behaviour of complex biological and physiological systems and less time wrangling with model composition.},

The BioModels Database is the largest online repository of SBML models. Several tools and platforms are available to support the reuse and composition of SBML models. However, these tools do not explicitly assess whether models are physically plausible or thermodynamically consistent. This often leads to ill-posed models that are physically impossible, impeding the development of realistic complex models in biology. Here, we present a framework that can automatically convert SBML models into bond graphs, which imposes energy conservation laws on these models. The new bond graph models are easily mergeable, resulting in physically plausible coupled models. We illustrate this by automatically converting and coupling a model of pyruvate distribution to a model of the pentose phosphate pathway.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Model exchange in systems and synthetic biology has been standardized for computers with the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and CellML, but specialized software is needed for the generation of models in these formats. Text-based model definition languages allow researchers to create models simply, and then export them to a common exchange format. Modular languages allow researchers to create and combine complex models more easily. We saw a use for a modular text-based language, together with a translation library to allow other programs to read the models as well., Summary: The Antimony language provides a way for a researcher to use simple text statements to create, import, and combine biological models, allowing complex models to be built from simpler models, and provides a special syntax for the creation of modular genetic networks. The libAntimony library allows other software packages to import these models and convert them either to SBML or their own internal format., Availability: The Antimony language specification and the libAntimony library are available under a BSD license from http://antimony.sourceforge.net/, Contact: lpsmith@u.washington.edu},

	abstract = {Motivation: Annotations of biochemical models provide details of chemical species, documentation of chemical reactions, and other essential information. Unfortunately, the vast majority of biochemical models have few, if any, annotations, or the annotations provide insufficient detail to understand the limitations of the model. The quality and quantity of annotations can be improved by developing tools that recommend annotations. For example, recommender tools have been developed for annotations of genes. Although annotating genes is conceptually similar to annotating biochemical models, there are important technical differences that make it difficult to directly apply this prior work. Results: We present AMAS, a system that predicts annotations for elements of models represented in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) community standard. We provide a general framework for predicting model annotations for a query element based on a database of annotated reference elements and a match score function that calculates the similarity between the query element and reference elements. The framework is instantiated to specific element types (e.g., species, reactions) by specifying the reference database (e.g., ChEBI for species) and the match score function (e.g., string similarity). We analyze the computational efficiency and prediction quality of AMAS for species and reactions in BiGG and BioModels and find that it has sub-second response times and accuracy between 80\% and 95\% depending on specifics of what is predicted. We have incorporated AMAS into an open-source, pip-installable Python package that can run as a command-line tool that predicts and adds annotations to species and reactions to an SBML model.
